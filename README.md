# Play-Sudoku-Solver
This is a graphical user interface where users can play the famous game of Sudoku. Additionally, users have to ability to make the program solve the board for them using a Sudoku solving backtracking algorithm; this algorithm is shown step-by-step so users can understand and picture how it works.

## Basic Controls on the User Interface

- When the user clicks on a cell, it becomes a teal color and is now the focused cell where numbers can go.

- The cells with a light gray background are the clues given in the original board and cannot be altered.

- Numbers are added to the focused cell using the keyboard, and if the added number is a duplicate in a row, column, or matrix, the numbers in the row, column or matrix will  turn red, respectively. Otherwise, the number remains purple.

- In this example, adding 2 in the 2nd row and 1st column breaks the row, column, and matrix, so the numbers in the row, column, and matrix all turned red.

- The Clear Board button clears user markings from the board.
